Modern robotics used in production facilities are typically surrounded by cages to prevent injury to personnel working at adjacent stations. Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (IAAAP) does not have the physical capital to support spacing out their assembly line with protective cages at each location where a mechanical arm would ideally be placed. Warehouse Autonomous Robotics (WAR) is focused on creating a robotic system that reduces manual effort in the factory and speeding up production rate while maintaining a low-risk environment.
